TODO
----
- efreet_desktop_command_* should free the exec strings for you (set free cb on execs list in _build()). need to make sure users of this function are updated when this change is made (e.g. e17's exec cb)
- Efreet_Menu should setup an Ecore_File_Monitor on the .menu files and the
  app_dir and reload the menu when needed

- The move handling is wrong when moving to a destination with /'s in the
  name. We should be creating intermediate menus for each of the /'d items
  instead of just making the name as we do now

- Add support for searching for a list of fallback icons in the current theme
  BEFORE looking in the inherited themes (e.g. for mime-types that go from
  specific to general).

- If a theme has several icon types (png, xpm..) prefer the first in the
  extension list.

- Add some ref/free tracking to check if users aren't abusing the system.

Notes from the Menu Spec test
-----------------------------
- We're appending the / to the menu names in the test case. We should
  possibly be doing that in the efreet code itself.
